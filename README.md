# K-Means Clustering for Disaster Risk Analysis

This project uses K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to identify areas in Sleman Regency, Indonesia, most vulnerable to strong wind disasters. Strong winds, such as storms and hurricanes, can cause significant damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and communities. By analyzing disaster-related data like disaster occurrence, fallen trees, and power disruptions, the project clusters districts to categorize them by risk level. These insights help local governments and disaster management agencies prioritize resources, improve preparedness, and enhance response strategies for high-risk areas.
## Data
- **Disaster Data**: Includes columns like `BanyakKejadian`, `PohonTumbang`, `JaringanListrik` representing disaster occurrence, fallen trees, and power disruptions, respectively.
- **Geospatial Data**: District shapefile `shp sleman.shp` used for mapping the districts and their corresponding risk labels.

This project is developed by Muna Faizatun Nabilah.
